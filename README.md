## Important
<ul>
<li>This is meant to help you, I cant tell you what to do, but c++ is an interesting language to say the least, it is worth to learn.</li>
<li>Read the requirements file to know what to create to get the program running</li>

<li>The homeworks require a cpp file to be uploaded.</li>
<ul>
<li>Replace ```#include "name.cpp"``` with nothing</li> 
<li>Replace ```name()``` with ```cout << "Submitted by: William Freire\n";```</li>

### Note
<ul>
<li>If you are using Visual Studio Code, the launch options will build the program for you meaning you only need to run the program. It will run in debug mode automatically, to change this, change the launch options in ```./.vscode/launch.json```</li>
