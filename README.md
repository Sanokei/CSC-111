# CSC-111
Assignments for CSC 111. Missing: `2-21, 3-5, 4-14`

## Important
* Read the requirements file
* If you are required to upload the cpp file
    * Replace `#include "name.cpp"` with nothing
    * Replace `name()` with `cout << "Submitted by: your-name\n";`
    * If you have questions you can ask them [here](https://github.com/Sanokei/CSC-111/discussions/1)


### Note
* If you are using Visual Studio Code, the launch options will build the program for you meaning you only need to run the program. It will run in debug mode automatically, to change this, change the launch options in `./.vscode/launch.json`
* **This is meant to help you, I cant tell you what to do, but c++ is an interesting language to say the least, it is worth to learn.**
* There will only be assignments/homework which makes up 30% of your grade.
